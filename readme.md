## Full Stack CRUD Assessment - todo

***This repo contains my solution to the following assessment challenge:***

### Server-Side
***DONE*** *- start 2:45pm, end 3:38pm except dotenv*

***DONE dotenv*** *- start 4:20pm, end 4:43pm*

1. Create the project structure
1. Choose a resource (superheros, cats, dogs, etc.)
1. Create the RESTful route structure, based on the resource of your choice:
  - GET ALL superheros
  - GET single superhero
  - POST ALL superheros
  - PUT single superhero
  - DELETE single superhero
1. Setup MongoDB, Mongoose, and define your schema
1. Update each route to connect to the database and return JSON
1. Use [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to manage environment variables

### Client-Side

***DONE*** *- start 9:23am, end 10:25am*

1. Render a single *index.html* file, which includes a form for adding (POST) a new superhero. Also, display ALL (GET) superheros below the form.
1. Handle client-side form validation with HTML5 attributes.
1. Handle the form submission with jQuery. This must be a SPA (single page application)

### Deployment

1. Deploy to Heroku
